Description: A toolbox for constructing potential landscapes for Ising
		networks, which can be estimated by the `Isingfit` package 
		<https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=IsingFit>. The landscapes 
		preserve the steady-state distribution of the original model
		with Glauber dynamics (Glauber, 1963) <doi:10.1063/1.1703954>
		and can be used for visualizing and quantifying the stability 
		of different activation states and visualizing the simulation 
		process.
